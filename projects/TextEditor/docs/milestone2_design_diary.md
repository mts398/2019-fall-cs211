# Design Diary 2

I really struggled with this milestone because I felt especially lost. A few things
I realized between the first milestone and this milestone was that this project
requires a lot of attention, time, and research. I don't think I've put nearly
enough time into this project as I should and would like to. I also realized that
working on this project takes patience as well. Patience and attention to detail. 

When I worked on the second milestone for the first time, I couldn't get loading
in a file to work - or at least I thought. After a few failed attempts of loading
a file, I felt discouraged and frustrated because it's something I should've known
from previous classes. When I worked on the project again a week later after talking
to a few classmates and adjusting my text file, I realized my file had been loading - 
I just didn't realize it. I couldn't tell it was loading because my file contents 
blended in with text from my output window. 

After realizing that, I felt a pretty ridiculous but really relieved. I reached that 
point because I asked for help and felt more comfortable playing around with my code.
That was an issue before because I didn't know my code enough to change part of it to
fit what I wanted to do.

Currently, I'm able to load in a file, but it looks like only the last line is displaying
in my text window and the line placement is a little off. To improve my performance 
in the future, I plan on setting a good chunk of time to only work on this project.
Hacking away while only worrying about the project would probably work more than 
avoiding it entirely because I'm unsure of what to do. 

It's disheartening that I don't know how to proceed or progress with the project, but
I have to keep reminding myself that I can speak with my peers and my professor for
tips on how to get to the next step. For now, it's mostly on my end to commit more time
to this project than I have before. I'll try out paper prototyping and planning out
my project in more detail before I go into coding because that might be a large factor
as to why I constantly feel lost while working on the project. 

Other than those struggles, experiencing a win (loading part of my file into my text
window) sparked motivation again. I'll keep reminding myself to ask questions when I 
need to, spend and allot time for this project, work on it bit by bit throughout the
week versus at the end, and to look on the brightside.
