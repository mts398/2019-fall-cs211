I finally made and had time to sit down and pay 100% of my attention to the text editor - it
felt great! After last week's check-in, I was reminded that I'm the kind of person that works 
and codes better if I have a good understanding of what my goal or purpose is for a project. 
Instead of going headfirst into the milestone like I did before, I took a good, long time reading 
through the milestone directions and understanding what I should try to have done before the 
milestone deadline. It immediately helped me start off on a better foot because I already feel 
less stressed and anxious. A huge play in that is because I now have a physical copy I can refer 
to and check off when I accomplish part of the project. It's reassuring to have a physical task 
list in addition to the Github project and issue tracker; I wouldn't say I've utilized the Github
trackers very well, but taking time to understand the requirements of the project by paper solidified 
my understanding to use the Github trackers more often. 
Since the start of the project, I've struggled with not knowing what to do, how to do it, constant
worry, and not knowing how to ask questions that'll help me progress with the project. I learned that
a few things I can do to overcome that obstacle is to not worry too much, sleep, and to take time to 
plan and design what I want to do BEFORE I attempt to write code for the project.
