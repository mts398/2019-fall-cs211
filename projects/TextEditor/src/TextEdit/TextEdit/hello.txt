CLEAN WATER IS essential for life, but most people in the developed world 
don't think much about the water they use for drinking, food preparation, and 
sanitation. In developing nations, however, the search for safe drinking water 
can be a daily crisis. Millions of people die each year, most of them children, 
from largely preventable diseases caused by a lack of access to clean water and 
proper sanitation.

Sandra Postel, director of the Global Water Policy Project and the National 
Geographic Society's freshwater fellow, said freshwater scarcity presents a 
growing problem to be addressed during the United Nations Conference on Sustainable 
Development (Rio+20) in Brazil from June 20 to 22. "It manifests itself in the 
depletion of groundwater, and the drying up of rivers and lakes upon which people
 depend for irrigation to grow their food," she said. "The intersection of water
 scarcity, food security, and a changing climate on top of it all raises a suite 
of water concerns that urgently need to be addressed."

Much progress is possible. In fact, due to the dedicated efforts of governments 
and NGOs since the 1992 Earth Summit, safe drinking water has been made available 
to some 1.7 billion people around the world, with projects ranging from modern 
piped plumbing to rainwater collection and storage.
